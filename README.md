Bootstrap a kubeadm Kubernetes Cluster on Scaleway!
===========================================

This repository contains terraform scripts to bootstrap a Kubernetes Cluster on Scaleway with as little configuration as possible. All you're going to need:

* Scaleway Account
* Domain connected to Cloudflare

With Scaleway, you'll be able to get a (3-Node) Kubernetes Cluster running for less than 10â‚¬ a month, which is the cheapest I've seen from any cloud provider.

# Features

These script will allow you to:

* Bootstrap a working Kubernetes Cluster using Kubeadm
* Create DNS entries on Cloudflare for your masters and nodes (useful for development)
* Once Bootstrapped, you'll have the ability to scale the amount of Cluster Nodes dynamically.

## Opinions

The Cluster we'll create with this config is a bit opinionated:

Software we'll use:

* Ubuntu Xenial as the OS, because of its excellent Kubernetes support
* Flannel for Pod Networking, though you can disable the installation of this and install your own

About the Cluster we'll create: *(not yet implemented, coming soon)*

* The Master Node will also be the Cluster Ingress (handle incoming traffic)
* These `kube-system` services will be installed: 
* - Kubernetes Dashboard for easy monitoring
* - nginx-ingress-controller for handling ingress
* - kube-lego for provisioning Letsencrypt certificates dynamically

Of course, you can just skip the cluster creation step by setting `install_kubernetes_services` to false in `terraform.tfvars`. 

## Caveats

This is in heavy development, the following things are to consider for now before using this:

* Kubernetes Nodes get public ip addresses and DNS Entries, this is a security concern and will be optional in the future. Only use this Cluster for development until then.
* only x86_64 Machines are supported currently, I'll begin working on ARM support soon
* No storage solution yet
